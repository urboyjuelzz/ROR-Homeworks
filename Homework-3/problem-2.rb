# Problem 2
# Create a class called Animal.
# Add an instance method to Animal called sound that returns a string indicating the sound an animal makes.
# Add an instance method to Animal called speak that prints the string The animal says: followed by the string returned by the sound method.
# Now create two subclasses of Animal (that is, classes whose parent class is Animal).
# Override the sound method of each of your subclasses to return a string appropriate for that particular animal instead of the string returned by the parent class.
# Call the speak method on an instance of each of your subclasses

class Animal
  def sound(talk)
    sound()
  end
  def speak()

end

class Cow << Animal
