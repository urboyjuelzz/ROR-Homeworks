# Problem 3
# Create a new Rails app.
# Commit the code for your new Rails app immediately after creating it. In this and subsequent homeworks we will be creating new Rails apps many timesâ€”please always commit the newly initialized Rails app before making any changes to it. This will make it easy for me to see just the code you have written. If you intermingle your code with all the base code for the Rails app iself, be forewarned that I will ask you to resubmit the homework!
# Create a controller called HomeworkController.
# Create two views for HomeworkController and add some content of your choosing to them.
# Add routes for each of your views so that they are accessible at URLs of your choosing.
