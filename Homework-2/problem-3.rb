# Problem 3
# What is an instance variable in Ruby? Try to find the answer via Google and explain it in your own words.
# Use the Ruby documentation (Links to an external site.) to choose a method from the Integer class and describe what it does in your own words.



# instance variable = seems to be a variable associated with a class that can be used to instanciate objects. i believe that initialize can be considered and instance variable.

# The integer class seems to just be a fixnum. so basically a number type that you can use to perform multiple operations (Math).
