# Write a function called add that takes two parameters, adds them together, and returns the result. For example, add(1, 2) should return 3.
# Then, add a line that calls your add function with two numbers of your choosing, stores the result in a variable with a name of your choosing, and then prints the result to the screen.

def add(one, two)
  return one + two
